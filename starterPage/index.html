        <h1>Just a Block Game</h1>
        <p>Just a Block Game is an interactive LED cube, referenced from the popular video game Minecraft, that reflects inputs in a digital interface.</p>

        <p>The block detects a "mining" interaction that dims the block as players get closer to mining completion and receiving a diamond drop that shows up on the inventory UI.</p>
